[Netris Operator](https://github.com/netrisai/netris-operator) is a Kubernetes Operator for managing and automating tasks related to managing a Netris Cloud.

[Netris](https://netris.ai) is an automatic netops platform that turns your physical network into a service. Netris uses application service metadata, simple rules, and an understanding of the organizational structure to satisfy your applicationsâ€™ connectivity needs. Netris ensures that your applications can communicate through continuous monitoring and analyses, and remediates any anomalies that may arise, resulting in up to a 90% reduction in ops time, and also reducing ops costs by up to 80%.
